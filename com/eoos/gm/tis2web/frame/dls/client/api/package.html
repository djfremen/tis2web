Provides the API for the desktop launch security (DLS) service.


<h2>Specification and API Usage</h2>
The DLS is based on the concept of a {@link com.eoos.gm.tis2web.frame.dls.client.api.Lease lease}. 
Each time a client request application start from within the web application, it will in turn receive a lease that
allows for local startup until the lease expires. A client application therefore 
{@link com.eoos.gm.tis2web.frame.dls.client.api.DLSServiceFactory creates
an instance of the Desktop Launch Security service} which it {@link com.eoos.gm.tis2web.frame.dls.client.api.DLSService#getLease(com.eoos.gm.tis2web.frame.dls.client.api.DLSService.ServerSelection) queries for a valid lease}.
If no lease can be found or the lease is expired, a corresponding exception is thrown. Furthermore if the client
is interested in the expiration date it may call the {@link com.eoos.gm.tis2web.frame.dls.client.api.DLSService#getExpirationDate(com.eoos.gm.tis2web.frame.dls.client.api.Lease) corresponding service method}.
